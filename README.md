JavaScript Development Environment with Cory House

## introduction
**Apart from learning how to setup my JavaScript Development Environment, I am using this README to practice how to use Markdown elements. So, I'll be updating this README file as I progress with the project.**

A Starter kit in simple terms is an **automated checklist**. It speeds development, increases quality and reduces fatigue. Once it is set up, you can use it for future projects.
